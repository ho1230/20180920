# Exercises
Each exercise has its own code directory and a corresponding test file (containing unit tests) under tests/. The executable "run" (built along with "test" when you run "make") will run the code, using the runner for each exercise, and "test" will run the tests.

I encourage you to look at all the code to see how things are organized and work together, but your primary job is to:
1. Write the code in the corresponding code folder. Look at the comments in the starter code (what you see initially) as a guideline for what and how you need to implement. I will also explain further in class.
2. Add unit tests as directed. The starter code will always contain some tests, and for the first few exercises you won't need to write any tests, but will gradually start adding them. Get into the habit of thinking how you need to write the code in such a way that you can test them with unit tests.
3. Add the runner code in run.cpp as necessary.
4. Build with "make" and run the resulting "run" and "test" executables to make sure everything is good.

NOTE: Do note change anything except inside the code (e.g., ex1/) and tests/ folders!
